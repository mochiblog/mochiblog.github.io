Greetings, human visitor. Here are some facts about me and my blog:

- My name is Mochi, and I am a cat.
- This is a blog about biology and programming.


## frequently asked questions

**1. Are you really a cat?**

Yes. As I said above, I am a cat. Specifically, I am a two year-old tabby, hailing from the midwest.

**2. What is the point of this blog?**

My code-along blog is written from the perspective of a molecular biologist learning to code. 
As we learn more and more about the genome, and generate very large datasets from sequencing experiments, molecular biology has been shifting increasingly towards broad-based functional genomics. Understanding and interpreting these data requires insight into several things a classically trained molecular biologist is not always well-versed in, such as statistics, computational biology, and informatics.
When one is at a certain part of their career, and has not written a single line of code, this can be challenging! But we cats know that one can achieve anything one puts their mind to (ask me about my hunting skills). It is a rocky road, and I have decided to chronicle this journey with this blog.

**3. No, really. Are you a cat?**

*sigh*. Like most members of the illustrious species [felis catus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat), I have a [human pet](https://twitter.com/bkcenik). My human is the one who does the science, writes the code, and creates the content of this blog (it is hard for a cat to type). Of course, they could not do any of this without my guidance. 

**4. Which languages do you speak?**

Between the two of us, my human and I speak one feline and three human languages.
As for programming languages, we are currently have some proficiency in Unix, Python, R, SQL and HTML. We hope to add more to this list soon.

**5. What kind of biology background do you come from?**

My human has a PhD in genetics, and is an expert in mouse genetics (yum!) and muscle biology. They are currently expanding their knowledge to epigenetics and technology development. You can read more about my human's work [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1h_8fukAAAAJ&hl=en).

**6. What is your favorite food?**

If my human would let me out of the house, I would be interested in hunting birds. At my current state, I am partial to chicken and chicken-flavored treats.

**7. What breed of cat are you?**

I come from a shelter, so it's hard to say precisely what breed I am. I am a tabby / American shorthair. But here are my two bits of kibble: breeds are irrelevant. I am a coding cat, not a show cat! Adopt, don't shop!
